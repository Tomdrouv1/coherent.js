## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 7c1f5bd: Let the form builder express a production form.

  **Forms work without JavaScript again.** `buildForm()` emitted
  `onsubmit="handleSubmit(event)"` on every form — naming a global the package
  never defines, since `hydrateForm` binds its own listener — plus `novalidate`,
  which turns off the browser validation a no-JS submission depends on.
  `novalidate: false` was ignored. Both are now off by default: the form posts to
  its `action` and validates natively with JavaScript disabled. Opt back in with
  `enhance: true` (or a handler string) and `novalidate: true`. This also stops
  the builder emitting markup that a strict CSP blocks.

  **`attributes` is honoured.** It was declared on `FormField` and read by
  nothing, so `autocomplete`, `maxlength`, `tabindex` and `data-*` were silently
  dropped. Attributes are applied before the builder's own, so `name`, `id`,
  `type` and the `aria-*` pair cannot be overridden, and names that are not valid
  HTML attribute names are rejected — `formatAttributes` escapes attribute values
  but interpolates names raw. `disabled` and `readonly` are honoured too.

  **Class names are yours.** A `classNames` option covers the wrapper, label,
  control, invalid state, error message and submit button, defaulting to the
  previous values and exported as `DEFAULT_CLASS_NAMES`. Per-field `className`
  appends to the control class. `hydrateForm` now finds the field wrapper through
  the `data-field` attribute the builder already emitted rather than
  `.form-field`, and takes the same `classNames` so the classes it writes on
  failure match what the server rendered.

  Together these make a honeypot a plain field, with no dedicated API:

  ```js
  builder.field('website', {
    label: 'Website',
    className: 'contact-form__trap',
    attributes: { tabindex: '-1', autocomplete: 'off' },
  });
  ```

  **Hidden fields are no longer rendered or validated.** `buildForm()` ignored
  `visible: false` and `showWhen`, while `validate()` skipped only `showWhen` —
  so a conditionally hidden field rendered but was never validated, and a
  `visible: false` field could block submission with an error for a control that
  was never on the page. Both now use one predicate, and `visible: false` is
  final rather than something a truthy `showWhen` can override.

  Attributes named `on*` are refused: they are syntactically valid names whose
  string values render as inline handlers, which would reintroduce per field the
  script this release stopped emitting on the form.

  Controls also no longer carry an empty `class=""` or `placeholder=""`.

  Peer ranges on workspace packages move from `workspace:*` to `workspace:^`.
  `workspace:*` publishes as an exact pin — `@coherent.js/forms@1.0.1` required
  `@coherent.js/core` at exactly `1.0.1` — so upgrading any one package
  conflicted with every other, and every release had to move all twelve in
  lockstep. `^` lets a consumer take a core minor without republishing the rest.

## 1.0.0-beta.3

### Patch Changes

- CLI generators were producing projects with outdated dependency versions (`1.0.0-beta.1`) instead of the current framework version (`1.0.0-beta.2`), causing installation conflicts and inconsistent package management.

  Updated all hardcoded Coherent.js package versions from `1.0.0-beta.1` to `^1.0.0-beta.2` across all generator files:

  **Files Modified:**
  - `packages/cli/src/generators/runtime-scaffold.js`
  - `packages/cli/src/generators/database-scaffold.js`
  - `packages/cli/src/generators/package-scaffold.js`
  - `packages/cli/src/generators/project-scaffold.js`

  **Packages Updated:**
  - `@coherent.js/core`: `^1.0.0-beta.1` → `^1.0.0-beta.2`
  - `@coherent.js/cli`: `^1.0.0-beta.1` → `^1.0.0-beta.2`
  - `@coherent.js/express`: `1.0.0-beta.1` → `^1.0.0-beta.2`
  - `@coherent.js/fastify`: `1.0.0-beta.1` → `^1.0.0-beta.2`
  - `@coherent.js/koa`: `1.0.0-beta.1` → `^1.0.0-beta.2`
  - `@coherent.js/database`: `^1.0.1` → `^1.0.0-beta.2`
  - `@coherent.js/api`: `^1.0.0` → `^1.0.0-beta.2`
  - `@coherent.js/client`: `^1.0.0` → `^1.0.0-beta.2`
  - `@coherent.js/i18n`: `^1.0.0` → `^1.0.0-beta.2`
  - `@coherent.js/forms`: `^1.0.0` → `^1.0.0-beta.2`
  - `@coherent.js/devtools`: `^1.0.0` → `^1.0.0-beta.2`
  - `@coherent.js/seo`: `^1.0.0` → `^1.0.0-beta.2`
  - `@coherent.js/testing`: `^1.0.0` → `^1.0.0-beta.2`
  - ✅ All 51 CLI tests pass
  - ✅ Generated projects install dependencies correctly
  - ✅ No empty files are generated
  - ✅ TypeScript configuration works properly
  - ✅ All generator types function (components, pages, APIs, models, middleware)
  - **Users now get projects with correct, up-to-date dependency versions**
  - **Eliminates package conflicts during installation**
  - **Ensures consistent framework behavior across generated projects**
  - **Maintains compatibility with latest Coherent.js features**

  Verified with multiple configurations:
  - Basic projects with all runtime options (built-in, Express, Fastify, Koa)
  - Full-stack projects with database integration (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB)
  - Authentication scaffolding (JWT and session-based)
  - All optional packages enabled
  - Both JavaScript and TypeScript projects
  - Component, page, API, model, and middleware generation

  **No breaking changes** - this is a pure bug fix release that ensures version consistency.

- Updated dependencies
  - @coherent.js/core@1.0.0-beta.3

## 1.0.0-beta.2

### Patch Changes

- Added comprehensive TypeScript type definitions
- Updated internal dependencies to use workspace protocol

## 1.0.0-beta.1

### Features

- Initial beta release
- Database adapters for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and MongoDB
- TypeScript type definitions included
- Full documentation and examples

### Notes

This is the first beta release of Coherent.js. The API is stable but may receive minor adjustments based on feedback before the 1.0.0 stable release.
