   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
   - Potential impact of the vulnerability
   - Any possible mitigations you've identified

3. **Give us a reasonable amount of time** to address the vulnerability before disclosing it publicly.

## Security Updates

When security vulnerabilities are discovered and addressed, we will:
- Release a new version with the fix as soon as possible
