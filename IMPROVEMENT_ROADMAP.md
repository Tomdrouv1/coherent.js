# üöÄ Coherent.js Framework Improvement Roadmap

## Project Analysis Summary

**Coherent.js** is a comprehensive, monorepo-based JavaScript framework for server-side rendering using pure JavaScript objects.

### üèóÔ∏è **Current Architecture Overview**

**Type**: Monorepo with 9 specialized packages
- **Core Philosophy**: Object-based rendering without JSX or build steps
- **Primary Language**: JavaScript (ES6+ modules)
- **Package Manager**: PNPM with workspaces
- **Target Runtime**: Node.js 20+

### üì¶ **Package Structure**

The framework is modularized into focused packages:

1. **@coherentjs/core** - Main rendering engine and component system
2. **@coherentjs/api** - REST/RPC/GraphQL API framework with OpenAPI support  
3. **@coherentjs/database** - Multi-database adapter layer (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB)
4. **@coherentjs/client** - Client-side hydration and progressive enhancement
5. **@coherentjs/cli** - Development CLI with scaffolding and generators
6. **@coherentjs/express** - Express.js integration
7. **@coherentjs/fastify** - Fastify integration
8. **@coherentjs/koa** - Koa.js integration  
9. **@coherentjs/nextjs** - Next.js integration

### üìä **Current Development Health**

**Test Coverage**: 52% overall (17,000/32,702 lines covered)
- **CLI Package**: 87% (excellent)
- **Database Package**: 80% (good) 
- **API Package**: 57% (moderate)
- **Core Package**: 45% (needs improvement)
- **Client Package**: 37% (needs improvement)

**Performance Benchmarks**:
- **9,627 req/s** (HTTP/1.1) - outperforms Express.js by 27.7%
- **8,745 req/s** (HTTP/2) - competitive with pure Node.js
